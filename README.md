# Customer-Segmentation

Segment customers based on quantity and total amount spent using K-Means clustering.

Further analysis on the K-Means with standardization, elbow + silhouette methods for optimal k, is performed



\# 🧩 Customer Segmentation Using KMeans


\## 🧠 Project Summary



This project performs customer segmentation using transaction data from an online retail store. It analyzes customer behavior by calculating total spending and quantity purchased per customer, then applies \*\*KMeans clustering\*\* to group customers into distinct segments.



Key steps include:

\- Reading and cleaning data from an Excel file

\- Aggregating total spend and purchase quantity per customer

\- Scaling the data for effective clustering

\- Applying \*\*KMeans\*\* to identify customer segments

\- Visualizing the segments with scatter plots

\- Saving the results for further analysis



📊 This helps identify customer patterns such as high spenders, bulk buyers, and potential churners — useful for marketing, loyalty programs, or targeting campaigns.



\## 📊 Customer Segmentation Visualization



Here’s a visual representation of the customer clusters based on `Quantity` and `Total Spent`.

# 🧾 Customer Segmentation Project: Further Analysis
# 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to segment retail customers based on their purchasing behavior using the RFM model (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) and apply K-Means clustering to uncover actionable customer groups. This helps marketing teams to tailor their strategies based on segment behavior.


# ✅ What's Been Improved

# 🔄 Refactored and Modular Code

The improved version of the script (improvedsegmenter.py) includes clear structuring with meaningful sections:

\- Data loading & preparation

\- RFM feature engineering

\- Standardization

\- Clustering optimization

\- Final segmentation

\- Visualization

\- Output saving

# 🔢 RFM Model Overview
Metric	          Definition

\- Recency:	          Days since the customer’s last purchase

\- Frequency:	        Number of transactions (invoices) by the customer

\- Monetary:	        Total amount spent by the customer

Each customer’s RFM score is computed and standardized to ensure balanced clustering.

# 📈 Plot Explanations
# 1. Elbow Method

Purpose: To identify the optimal number of clusters (k) by examining the inertia (sum of squared distances within clusters).

![](data/elbow_plot.png)

What to look for:

A “bend” or “elbow” in the plot.

This indicates diminishing returns in inertia reduction as k increases.

In this project:

The elbow appeared at k = 4, suggesting 4 is a good choice for cluster count.

# 2. Silhouette Score Plot

Purpose: Measures how well samples are clustered — values range from -1 to 1 (higher is better).

![](data/silhouette_plot.png)

What to look for:

Peaks indicate the most natural separation between clusters.

In this project:

k = 4 also had one of the highest silhouette scores, confirming the elbow method result.

# 3. Segment Scatterplot (rfm_segmentation.png)

Purpose: Visualizes the final customer segments in RFM space.

![](data/rfm_segmentation.png)

Colors: Each color represents a different customer segment.
Red 'X' markers represent cluster centroids.

# Interpretation:

Customers in the bottom-right (low recency, high monetary) are likely high-value active customers.

Those in top-left are churned or low-value.

## 📊 Segment Summary (Example Output)

| Segment | Recency (mean) | Frequency (mean) | Monetary (mean) | Count |
|---------|----------------|------------------|------------------|-------|
| 0       | 12.34          | 8.76             | 1032.56          | 250   |
| 1       | 153.20         | 2.12             | 345.09           | 620   |
| 2       | 45.67          | 4.56             | 478.23           | 430   |
| 3       | 205.10         | 1.20             | 187.00           | 700   |


# 🟢 Interpretation:

Segment 0 – Low recency, high frequency and monetary → likely loyal, high-value customers

Segment 3 – High recency, low values → at-risk or churned customers

# 🧠 Conclusions and Next Steps
# 📌 Key Takeaways:

\- 4 customer segments discovered using RFM + K-Means

\-Clustering was validated using both Elbow and Silhouette methods

\-Insights can be used for personalized marketing or retention strategies

# 📈 Business Value:

Target Segment 0 for loyalty programs and upsells

Re-engage Segment 3 with win-back campaigns

Grow Segment 2 into higher spenders

# 🛠️ Future Enhancements

🧪 Use other clustering techniques (e.g., DBSCAN, Hierarchical)

🧠 Use PCA or t-SNE for better visualization

🧮 Automate RFM scoring tiers (e.g., High, Medium, Low)

📊 Build an interactive dashboard (e.g., with Streamlit)
